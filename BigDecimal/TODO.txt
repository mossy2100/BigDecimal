Test and improve (where necessary) all conversion methods.

Check all methods to see if there are any that take BigInteger or BigDecimal parameters, but that
don't mutate those parameters. Then I can use "in" to pass by reference and improve efficiency.

Test and debug Sqrt().

Update conversion functions to not use strings.
