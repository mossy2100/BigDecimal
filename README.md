# Galaxon.BigNumbers

This solution contains 3 related types:

- BigRational: A ratio of two BigIntegers.
- BigDecimal: A decimal number with configurable precision and very large range of exponents.
- BigComplex: A complex number type based on BigDecimal.

## Dependencies

- BigRational relies on Galaxon.Core
- BigDecimal relies on Galaxon.BigNumbers.BigRational
- BigComplex relies on Galaxon.BigNumbers.BigDecimal.

## Feedback

Please let me know if you find any bugs, would like to see new features added, or can see ways the
type can be made more performant or otherwise improved.
